# To Do List - React
This is one of my first projects using REACT. I've tried to remake my first to-do-list when I've used just Vanila JavaScript. The main point of the application
is to create a simple list of to-do things just by typing them into the placeholder. We can delete them or just mark them as done, using the check and trash buttons from the right.



## Demo

## Features
- A placeholder for typing the to-do things;
- One interactive button which let us send the text to our list;
- Two interactive buttons which let us delete or mark the row as checked.

## Lessons Learned

The main lesson was to understand how a component and JSX work, how to work with events in React, to call a function when a specific button is clicked, as well as organizing the components and applying the UseState hooks. 

I've learned how props work and how to implement them in our code.
## Optimizations

It was a good starting point to understand some of the main concepts of REACT, to make my application more composable, by combining a few parts and make a whole.
